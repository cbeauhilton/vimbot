# Code Status Discussion Katie Sunthankar --- - The approach to obtaining someone’s code status should be thoughtful and pertinent to their current admission or recent change in clinical status - Ask yourself “Why would this patient code? Is resuscitation a reversible treatment in this patient’s case? What are the chances that this patient will survive to discharge following CPR? Is the anticipated outcome in line with the patient’s goals? - After you have made your assessment, help patient make an educated decision based on both the efficacy of resuscitation and the patient’s goals - Below are examples of phrases that can be used in framing code status. - NEVER say “Do you want us to do everything?” Most patients will respond yes to this even if they do not want CPR - It is more helpful to give examples of when these situations would arise and make recommendations based on your medical judgment factoring in patient's goals ## Admitting a patient: - **Introduction**: Normalize the conversation by stating “these are questions we routinely ask everyone when they come into the hospital. This is a way for us to understand your wishes in the event you are unable to make your own decisions.” - **Surrogate**: “If you were unable to make decisions for yourself, who would you trust to make your decisions? The person you pick should be able to speak to your wishes and make the same choices you would make for yourself” - \-**Intubation**: Always do this first so you can avoid the sticky DNI but not DNR situation. Again, normalize the question. “Everyone has different opinions on what types of medical care they would want if they became sicker. One of the things we like to talk about are ventilators or breathing machines. Some tell us to try a breathing machine for a trial, but they would not want to be kept alive on a ventilator.” Now make a recommendation. “In your case I think if you were to need a ventilator, I think it would \[work, not work,\]” Pause and allow them to ask questions. Also remember that if they say DNI, then they must be DNR because intubation occurs with ACLS (this is not allowed at VUMC. # The Death Pronouncement Michael J. Neuss --- This scenario arises in a variety of contexts, including the units, wards, and cross-cover. You might know the patient and family well, but particularly when cross covering, that may not be the case - This approach to the death pronouncement is based in part on the AAFP’s “Death Pronouncement: Survival Tips for Residents” (Am Fam Physician. 1998 Jul 1;58(1):284-285.) ## Before Entering: - Familiarize yourself with the most important points of the patient’s hospitalization and recent events. Be aware of the circumstances of the patient’s death, particularly whether death was expected or sudden. - Inquire as to which family is present including whether the POA is currently at bedside - In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the patient’s nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that might also be a consideration. ## In The Room: - Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you - Less is more when it comes to what you say: it can be good to be empathetic (consider only short statements such as “I am sorry for your loss”) but focus mainly on the task at hand, allowing time for families to be present with their loved one - Explain that you have been called to examine the patient to confirm that they have passed. Allow a brief time for questions; it is rare (but not impossible) that someone may wish to excuse themselves for the pronouncement - Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check the time of death ## The Exam and Pronouncement - Identify the patient by wrist band - Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli; one discreet way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the body - Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations and absence of heart sounds. Listen for a full minute as some patients have extended periods of apnea - Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex - Note the time at which your examination is completed. Listen for a full minute as some patients have extended periods of apnea - Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex - Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the time of death - Make sure to ask if the family would like an autopsy to be performed. This is often overlooked, and as awkward as it might feel to ask for this, it is a requirement - Make sure you have notified the attending of record - Please see further VA- and VUMC-specific guidance below ## Death Process at VUMC - The key thing is to ensure that all components are completed in the “Discharge as Deceased” tab under the Transfer-Discharge screen - EACH AND EVERY component of this tab must be completed before Decedent Affairs will accept the body Required steps: - Cardiopulmonary Death Charting -> Select “New Reading” and complete. - Cardiopulmonary Death -> Select “+Create Note” - Medical Examiner Criteria -> Select “+New Reading”; Criteria requiring notification of ME is listed in a drop down menu in the navigator. Includes accidental deaths, threats to public health, suspicion for foul play, etc. The Vanderbilt Operator can assist with connecting you to the ME; alternatively, you can call 615-743-1800 during business hours (M-F 8am – 4:30pm) or the after-hours pager at 800-216-0107. - All patients diagnosed with Covid are automatic ME cases - Autopsy Criteria -> Select “+New Reading” - Preliminary Cause of Death and Date/Time of Death ->. Rather than list “Cardiopulmonary arrest,” be specific (e.g., Pulmonary Embolism, Myocardial Infarction, Metastatic Colon Cancer, etc.) - Deceased’s Info – Report of Death - If you need to leave this and return later after collecting information, you can access your partially complete entries by clicking on the date/time text that appears under the ribbon. This is not intuitive because the numbers listing the date/time do not at all appear as though they act like a hyperlink (but they do). - Be specific; TDS will want you to have listed the name of the family you notified, the TDS Case Number (which the RN typically enters), and your attending physician’s name (to sign the death certificate; give their pager number in this subsection). # Running Codes Jacqueline Visina --- ## Arrival to a Code - Questions to answer when you arrive: Is someone running the code? Who is doing compressions? Do we have pads on the patient? What is our IV access? - Take charge: establish if anyone is actively running the code, if someone is running the code, introduce yourself and ask how you may be helpful. If someone is NOT, have someone begin chest compressions IMMEDIATELY and assume responsibility for the running the code - IV access: IV access preferred, if no immediate IV access, place IO - Obtain a brief medical history and events surrounding the code and the patient’s code status - Have someone find the nearest crash cart and get pads on the patient as soon as possible ## Running the Code - Assess the rhythm - If Vfib/VT- immediately shock - For polymorphic VT, this is ischemia until proven otherwise unless the patient is on a large amount of QTc prolonging medications. - If PEA/Asystole- resume compressions, give Epi 1mg ASAP - Strong ACLS - Q2min- pulse check, rhythm check, shock? - Remember the two interventions with proven mortality benefit are high quality chest compressions and early defibrillation. Do not interrupt these actions for other things - Monitor the quality of chest compressions - Warn resuscitators when shock is being delivered - Consider Advanced Airway - Remember chest compressions save lives. Not intubation. Do not stop compressions for intubation - Stay Calm - Closed Loop communication- continue giving instructions, use names, minimize interruptions - Do not move from foot of bed if you are running the code - Ensure delivery of adequate compressions. Avoid excessive ventilation - If you are running the code, it is helpful to maintain a constant verbal running summary of interventions that have been tried and the course of the code - Have a member of the team locate an ultrasound for line placement and diagnostics - Allow family to be present - H’s and T’s: Treat Reversible Factors - Some of the fellows here will empirically give 2 grams of magnesium, 1 amp of D50, 1 amp of bicarb, and 1g calcium chloride at the onset of the code irrespective of presenting rhythm - Can send Labs – ask for a “loaded gas”. This will usually be a VBG/ABG with lactate, K, Ca, and Hgb. admit daily until 5:30 PM, sign-out 6 PM - Each HPI usually requires special info about the patient’s subspecialty diagnosis; refer to primer documents that are available for most subspecialty services in the chief's "welcome to the wards" email, and see tips below ### Rogers Hepatology - Rounds typically at 8 AM, team meets on 6MCE - Pager: 831-4782 - Work room: 6MCE, room 6755 near the elevators (no code) - Review: Hepatology Section, Paracentesis (Procedures), and 'Surviving Rogers Hep' primer - Tips: structure one-liner as “cirrhosis secondary to \_\_\_ decompensated by \_\_\_ (EV bleed, ascites, SBP, HE, or HRS) who follows with \_\_\_ (hepatologist) and is \_\_\_ (listed / undergoing workup for / not listed) for transplant”; know patient MELD-Na scores (use the MELD-Na dot phrase or patient list column); anticipate at least diagnostic paracentesis on admission if any concern for SBP (abdominal pain, AMS, etc.) ### Rogers ID - Rounds typically at 8 AM, team meets in Resident Library (8N) - Pager: 831-4779 - Work room: 6 Round Wing, 2nd door on left after coming out of elevator (no code) - Tips: Each HPI for pt with HIV should include most recent CCC provider, CD4/Viral Load, prior AIDS-defining illnesses and compliance to ART; Use ‘Notifications’ tab on main screen in Epic to keep track of lab orders as patients can have long stays with send-out labs that can take up to two weeks to result (can also hit ‘Notify Me’ in dropdown box of Order) ### Rogers Pulmonology - Rounds typically at 8 AM, team meets at 8N nursing station - Pager: 831-4777 - Work room: 8 South 8216 (code 2430) - Tips: Each HPI should include most recent PFTs (FEV1% most important, include other relevant data or recent changes); For CF, Use the CF admission order set, know typical organisms in patient’s sputum (ex: MDR Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, MRSA) and consult CF team; Also remember that if they say DNI, then they must be DNR because intubation occurs with ACLS (this is not allowed at VUMC. It is technically allowed at the VA if the patient specifically requests but would not recommend routinely providing this option) - **CPR**: Prime this question with “The next question I have to ask you can be hard to think about, but it is important that we know what you would want in an emergency. Specifically, if you had a cardiac arrest where your heart stops beating and you die, would you want chest compressions to try and restart your heart? We know based on the evidence that CPR is not always successful. It really depends on the situation. In your case, I think CPR would be (make a recommendation here). Knowing this, would you want us to attempt CPR to resuscitate you?” - A helpful way to share data about the success of CPR: “Can I share some numbers about how often CPR can help?” Sometimes using fingers to show these numbers helps. “If you take 10 people in this hospital and all of their hearts stop beating, which would mean they have died, and we get to them as fast as possible, only 3 of them would have their hearts restarted and only 1 of them would ever leave the hospital.” ## What if you do not think performing CPR Is medically appropriate?… - At the end of the day, it is their decision (attendings may change the code status out of medical futility in Tennessee) - Code status can be revisited throughout the hospital stay, especially if the patient was initially overwhelmed or if their clinical status evolves. Sometimes patients find it helpful to have a family member or friend present - Consider framing the discussion differently and offer your recommendation: “While you are in the hospital, we will support you with interventions and medications that we think are helpful based on what you have told us important to you. However, we are worried that some of the interventions you are asking for may do more harm than good. Many people think that CPR works like it does on TV. Unfortunately, we know that most patients who need CPR in the hospital do not survive like they do on TV. In your case, we do not think it would bring you back to your current state. # Medical Oncology Resources Eric Lander --- ## Resources NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Center Network, ): consensus based treatment guidelines for most hematopoietic and solid tumors. Free for house staff. - comprehensive, expert-curated, wiki-style resource, seeks to catalogue all treatment regimens across all cancers. Born at VUMC. ## VUMC Oncology Rotation Tips The inpatient oncology rotation involves complex decisions often resulting from advancing diseases. The question “What do you want?” is too simple. Rather, it should be “Given your current circumstance, and given our choices, which path would you prefer to take?” Patients want advice from their outpatient doctors who have been caring for them for years. Therefore, treatment and goals discussions often must pass through the inpatient attending to the outpatient attending. Be sure to define how communication with this primary oncologist will be handled. Oncology summary sentence in presentation: 1. Cancer type and stage (at diagnosis – stage never changes even if progressed) 2. Pertinent tumor genetic information 3. Any relevant surgeries (e.g. resections) 4. Most recent treatment 5. Trajectory of disease (e.g. progressive, improving, or stable) 6. Patient’s primary oncologist Ex: Ms. X is a 64 y/o female w/ stage IIIa adenocarcinoma of the lung post resection now with metastases to the spine (patient of Dr. Y) admitted w/intractable back pain and leg weakness. Full NGS at diagnosis with no actionable mutations, and was 40% positive for PDL1. No previous chemo. - Be specific; TDS will want you to have listed the name of the family you notified, the TDS Case Number (which the RN typically enters), and your attending physician’s name (to sign the death certificate; give their pager number in this subsection). - Report of Death Note -> Select “+New Reading” and complete. - Complete Synopsis + Hospital Course and then at the very bottom under Summary of Death select “+Create Note.” - Once all of this paperwork is finished, be sure to touch base with the patient’s nurse, usually contact Decedent Affairs and assist in making sure the body is moved ## Death Process at the VA ![VA death pronouncement process](../images/va-death-pronouncement-process.png) VA death pronouncement process include other relevant data or recent changes); For CF, Use the CF admission order set, know typical organisms in patient’s sputum (ex: MDR Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, MRSA) and consult CF team; for PH know the therapies they are on (typically Flolan or Veletri) ### Rogers Renal - Rounds typically start 7-7:30 AM, team meets at resident/fellow work room on 6MCE - Pager: 831-4783 - Work room: 6MCE 6772, behind nursing station with renal fellows (no code) - Tips: Each HPI should have renal transplant history with year, type of transplant, PRA, Ag MM, CMV D/R; 6MCE charge nurse can get pts transferred there; alert the night cross-cover resident to patients with recent renal biopsy and low threshold to contact renal fellow; transplant pts should have daily tacro level one hour before AM tacro dose (5:00 am), regardless of pt’s home schedule and be cautious with first dose timing of immunosuppression to keep on schedule ## Cardiology Services (CHF, Harrison, and CCU) ### CHF - Heart Failure (1 & 2) - Team: 1 Res, 2 Interns on one team with pt cap of 8 per intern (16 total) - Pagers: CHF-A: 831-6485, CHF-B: 831-6486 - Pick up list at 6 AM, admit daily until 5PM (alternate admissions, resident to help assign) - Rounds typically at 7 AM, team meets at 7MCE nursing station - Workroom: 7N room 7024 right before bridge to 7MCE (code 145) - Tips: Know each patient’s dry weight (usually found in outpatient cards notes or at last discharge), know current outpatient diuretic regimen, know most recent TTE, RHC, and LHC results (keep this info accessible on rounds), order strict I&Os; Daily Standing Weights, and fluid restriction of 2L/day, obtain iron studies to assess need for IV iron, perform volume exams on patients before rounds ### Harrison (1 & 2) - Team: 1 Res, 1 Intern on each team with patient cap of 10 - Pagers: Harrison 1: 831-4769, # Video Examples for Navigating Difficult Conversations Mohana Karlekar --- Navigating difficult conversations with patients can be daunting especially if you have never seen someone do one well before. Conversations should follow a logical and sequential approach, much like any procedure we perform in medicine. Like all procedures, practice makes us better. ![QR code for difficult conversations video](../images/qr-code-navigating-difficult-conversations.svg){ width="300" } QR code [link](https://sso.service.vumc.org/idp/startSSO.ping?PartnerSpId=https%3A%2F%2Flearningexchange.vumc.org%2FAccount%2FSAML&TargetResource=https%3A%2F%2Flearningexchange.vumc.org%2F%23%2Fonline-courses%2Ff955c1a3-c682-4e43-91d6-1baf9cc1d7f3) for Learning Exchange module “Navigating Difficult Conversations With Patients” Good communicators have both **formulated** their message and **identified** which communication strategy to use before they initiate a conversation Here are some suggestions for “Navigating Difficult Conversations” - Step 1.
